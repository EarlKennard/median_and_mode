	fn choose_or_no
	fn user_answers
	prob another fn that checks if 1 mode, no mode, or multiple modes
	prob another fn that compares user mode answer to the actual answer(s)

vector_creations.rs :
	use rand::Rng;
	use crate::user_inputs::{user_input_int, user_input_str};

	pub fn vector_creator
	fn fully_random_vector
	fn partially_random_vector
	pub fn choose_parameters

user_inputs.rs :
	use std::io;

	pub fn user_input_str
	pub fn user_input_int

median_mode.rs :
	use std::collections::HashMap;

	pub fn median_in_vector
	pub fn mode_in_vector. 
		expand to check if no mode. if no mode, return an empty vec
		refactor to return a vec<i32>
		if only one mode, vec len should be 1. if multiple, len should be more than 1
	if main.rs can't handle the multiple mode cases, do it here. main.rs will handle answers

unit_tests.rs :
	use everything	
	
	#[test]
	fn choose_or_no_checker
		can i even test for invalid inputs? can i even test user input?
	fn vector_creator_interface_check
		idk how i'm gonna do this one. prob leave it for now since it relies on two other functions.
		probably a prime candidate for integration testing
	- idk how to test fully_random_vector(). prob can't. can maybe only test for the upper and lower 
	bounds and len
	- same for partial_random_vector. check bounds and len
	- idk how to test choose_parameters(). can probably only test input, and if that's the case,
	then it's better to test the input functions (if that's even possible for me)
	- can i even test the user input fns?
	fn median_in_vector_test
		should be more straightforward since i can test for the cases
	fn mode_in_vector_test
		check the possible cases
	fn mode_checker_test
		check the cases
	fn median_checker_test
		check the cases
	
	

not really sure if this file existing in the folder will affect the program in any way.
honestly same with the stupid picture. i hope it's fine.
